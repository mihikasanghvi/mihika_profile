        <p>I am a Master's student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science with a focus on the Machine Learning track. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with honors in Data Science from the College of Engineering Pune, where I engaged in diverse projects, from cat vs. dog image classification to creating my own snake game using reinforcement learning. I had the honor of collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NC3z3M8AAAAJ">Prof. Suraj Sawant</a> on pipeline routing optimization using artificial intelligence. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and software development, which I am eager to apply in real-world applications. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance decision-making processes across various domains.</p>
        <p>I gained valuable experience as a Software Engineer Intern at  <a href="https://www.slb.com/"> SLB</a>, where I worked as a Software Developer Intern. Currently, I serve as the AI and Cloud Computing Technical Lead at CareWear AI, a startup dedicated to innovative solutions in health and care management. </p>

            <h3>Image-Classification-using-Vision-Transformer</h3>
            <p>This project leverages the Vision Transformer (`ViT`) architecture, fine-tuning the pre-trained `google/vit-base-patch16-224` model with a custom classification head for binary image classification. Utilizing PyTorch, Transformers, and TorchVision, the model processes 224x224 images and achieves high accuracy, with evaluation including precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for a comprehensive performance assessment.</p>

            <h3>Reinforcement-Learning-based-AI-for-Snake-Game</h3>
            <p>This project utilizes Q-learning with a neural network (Linear_QNet) to train an AI agent to play the Snake game through reinforcement learning. By implementing a reward-based system in Pygame, the AI agent iteratively learns optimal strategies to maximize cumulative rewards while avoiding obstacles.</p>
